/*Description

Using bitwise operators, write a javascript function(that accepts a single array with arguments as a parameter) that uses an expression to find the value of the bit at index 3 of an unsigned integer read from the console.

The bits are counted from right to left, starting from bit 0.
The result of the expression should be either 1 or 0. Print it on the console.
Input

The only element of the parameter array, will be a positive integer as a string - the number whose 3rd bit you must print.
Output

Output a single number - 1 or 0 - the value of the 3rd bit, counted from 0 and from right to left.
You can use console.log to print the results or you can use return to return the answer. Both are correct.
Constraints

The input number will always be a valid positive integer number.
Time limit: 0.2s
