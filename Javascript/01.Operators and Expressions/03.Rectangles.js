/*Description

Implement a javascript function that takes an argument array as a parameter and calculates rectangle’s area and perimeter by given width and height. The width and height will both be passed in the argument array.

Input

The array that will be passed as argument will always have exactly 2 elements:
The first element - a floating-point number that will represent the width of the rectangle.
The second element - another floating-point number that will represent the height of the rectangle.
Output

Output a single line - the rectangle's area and perimeter, separated by a whitespace.
Print the area and perimeter values with exactly 2-digits precision after the floating point.
You can use console.log to print the results or you can use return to return the answer. Both are correct.
Constraints

The width and height will always be valid floating-point numbers.
Time limit: 0.2s
Memory limit: 16MB
